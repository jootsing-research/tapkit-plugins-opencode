# TapKit — iPhone Control

You have access to a physical iPhone through TapKit MCP tools. You can see the screen via screenshots and interact through taps, swipes, typing, and other gestures.

## Setup

**Every tool requires a `phone_id`.** Always start by calling `list_phones` to discover available phones — it returns IDs, connection status, and screen dimensions. Then pass the `phone_id` on every subsequent tool call.

```
list_phones → pick a phone_id → use phone_id on every call
```

## OpenCode Tool Names

OpenCode may expose MCP tools with the server name prefixed, such as `tapkit_list_phones`, `tapkit_screenshot`, `tapkit_tap`, or `tapkit_open_app`. If tool names are prefixed in the current OpenCode session, use those visible `tapkit_*` tools for the TapKit operations described below.

If a phone hasn't been set up for control yet, call `enable_switch_control(phone_id)` first — this enables Switch Control on the Mac for that phone. You only need to do this once per session.

**`select_phone`** is optional. It eagerly switches Switch Control to a phone, but actions on an inactive phone will auto-activate it. Only use `select_phone` if you want to pre-switch before a long sequence of actions on a specific phone.

## Use Tools First, Navigate Second

Always prefer a direct tool over manual navigation:

- **Opening apps**: call `open_app("Settings")` — don't scroll through home screens looking for the icon
- **Searching the phone**: call `spotlight("calculator")` — don't swipe down and hunt visually
- **Going home**: call `press_home` — don't swipe up from the bottom

Only use tap/swipe navigation for things **inside** an app where no tool shortcut exists.

## Core Loop

Your workflow is always: **screenshot → look → act → screenshot to verify**.

1. Take a `screenshot` to see what's on screen
2. Visually identify the element you need to interact with
3. Estimate the pixel coordinates of its **center**
4. Call the appropriate tool (tap, swipe, copy_text_to_phone, etc.)
5. Take another `screenshot` to confirm the action worked
6. If it didn't work, try a different approach

**Always screenshot before and after actions.** You have no other way to see the phone — no accessibility tree, no DOM, no element selectors. Everything is visual + coordinates.

## Coordinate System

Screenshots are resized so you see them at the same resolution as the coordinate space. **Coordinates map 1:1 with screenshot pixels** — if an element is at pixel (300, 672) in the image, tap (300, 672). Screen dimensions are returned by `list_phones` (typically around 618x1344).

- (0, 0) is the top-left corner
- x increases rightward, y increases downward
- Aim for the **center** of UI elements — iOS touch targets can be small
- The status bar is roughly the top 47px, the home indicator bar is the bottom ~37px

## Tools Quick Reference

### Navigation
- `open_app(app_name)` — Open any app by name (e.g. "Settings", "Safari", "Hinge")
- `press_home` — Go to home screen
- `spotlight(query?)` — Open Spotlight search, optionally type a query

### Touch Gestures
- `tap(x, y)` — Single tap. Use for buttons, links, icons, list items
- `double_tap(x, y)` — Double tap. Use for zooming or text selection
- `long_press(x, y, duration?)` — Tap and hold. Opens context menus. Default 1000ms
- `swipe(x, y, direction)` — Fast flick gesture at a point. Direction: "up", "down", "left", "right". Use for dismissing, switching pages, scrolling
- `drag(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y)` — Drag from one point to another. Use for sliders, precise scrolling, moving items
- `hold_and_drag(from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y, hold_duration_ms?)` — Long press then drag. Use for drag-and-drop, reordering lists

### Input
- `copy_text_to_phone(text)` — Load text onto the phone's clipboard for pasting into text fields (see **Text Input** section below)
- `activate_siri` — Trigger Siri voice assistant
- `escape` — Dismiss keyboards, alerts, popups, or modal screens

### Device
- `list_phones` — List all phones with connection status, IDs, and dimensions. **Call this first.**
- `select_phone(phone_id)` — Eagerly switch Switch Control to a phone (optional — auto-activates on use)
- `enable_switch_control(phone_id)` — Enable Switch Control on the Mac for a phone (required once per session)
- `screenshot` — Get current screen as an image
- `get_phone_status(phone_id)` — Get real-time status: connection, Switch Control, screen lock, streaming, dimensions
- `get_phone_info(phone_id)` — *(Deprecated — use `get_phone_status` instead.)* Returns screen dimensions and phone name
- `lock` / `unlock` — Lock or unlock the screen
- `volume_up` / `volume_down` — Volume controls
- `run_shortcut(index)` — Run an iOS Shortcut by its index number

## iOS Navigation Tips

- **Scroll down**: `swipe(300, 672, "down")` — flick downward from screen center
- **Go back** in an app: look for a "< Back" arrow in the top-left and tap it, or `swipe(10, 672, "right")` (left-edge swipe)
- **Dismiss a modal/popup**: look for "X", "Cancel", "Done", or tap outside it
- **Pull to refresh**: `drag(300, 200, 300, 600)` (drag down from top of content area)
- **Switch apps**: `swipe(300, 1300, "up")` (swipe up from bottom)
- **Close keyboard**: call `escape`, tap anywhere outside the keyboard, or `press_home`
- **Tab bars** at the bottom of apps are the main navigation — tap the icons to switch sections
- **iOS alerts** (permissions, confirmations) appear as centered popups — tap "Allow", "OK", etc.

## Text Input

TapKit cannot press individual keyboard keys reliably. Instead, typing is done via the **clipboard**: load text with `copy_text_to_phone`, then paste it into a text field using iOS's paste UI.

### Typing into an Empty/Inactive Text Field

1. **Load text onto the clipboard:** `copy_text_to_phone(text: "Your message here")`
2. **Long press on the text field** for ~1500ms. This activates the field, brings up the keyboard, and shows the **Paste** tooltip: `long_press(x, y, duration: 1500)`
3. **Tap "Paste"** in the tooltip that appears above the text field
4. **Screenshot to verify** the text was pasted correctly
5. To submit: tap the blue button on the keyboard (it says "Search", "Go", "Send", or "Done" depending on context). It's usually in the bottom-right area of the keyboard

### Replacing Existing Text

To replace text already in a field, use the **Select All + Paste** workflow:

1. **Load new text onto the clipboard:** `copy_text_to_phone(text: "New text")`
2. **Double-tap on any word** in the text field to select it: `double_tap(x, y)`
3. **Tap on an unhighlighted part** of the text field (a different spot from the selected word) — this shows the menu with **Select All**: `tap(x, y)`
4. **Tap "Select All"** to highlight everything
5. **Tap "Paste"** to replace all selected text with clipboard contents

### Clearing a Text Field

Use **Select All + Cut**:
1. Double-tap a word to select it
2. Tap on unhighlighted text to get the "Select All" option
3. Tap "Select All"
4. Tap "Cut"

### Text Selection Reference

| Action | Result | Menu shown |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `double_tap` on a word | Selects that word | Format, Cut, Copy, Paste, > |
| `tap` on unhighlighted text (while a selection exists) | Deselects, places cursor, shows basic menu | Paste, Select, Select All, AutoFill |
| `long_press` (~1500ms) on inactive text field | Activates field + keyboard, shows paste tooltip | Paste, AutoFill |

### Text Input Pitfalls

- **Don't try to tap individual keyboard keys.** The timing and precision required makes this unreliable. Always use the clipboard approach.
- **Don't simulate triple-tap with three separate `tap` calls.** The calls are too far apart in time. Use the double-tap + tap-on-unhighlighted-text pattern instead.
- **Long-pressing backspace is unreliable.** It deletes characters at an unpredictable rate. Prefer Select All + Cut/Paste.
- **Always screenshot after typing actions** to verify the result before proceeding.

## Common Patterns

**Opening an app:**
```
open_app("Settings") → screenshot to verify it opened
```

**Searching within an app:**
```
copy_text_to_phone("query") → long_press on search field (1500ms) → tap "Paste" → tap Search button on keyboard → screenshot
```

**Scrolling through a list:**
```
swipe(300, 672, "down") → screenshot → look for target → repeat if needed
```

**Handling a popup/alert:**
```
screenshot → identify the popup → tap the appropriate button (Allow, OK, Cancel, etc.)
```

## Important

- **Be precise with coordinates.** Off by 50px can mean tapping the wrong element
- **Always verify with screenshots.** Never assume an action succeeded
- **Apps take 1-2 seconds to load.** If a screenshot looks unchanged after tapping an app icon, take another screenshot — it may still be loading
- **If something doesn't work after 2-3 tries, try a different approach.** Don't keep tapping the same spot
- **You cannot handle Face ID, CAPTCHAs, or biometric prompts.** Tell the user if you encounter these
- **Don't type passwords** unless the user explicitly provided them in their request
